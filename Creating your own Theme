Mailspring Theme Starter 
The Mailspring Theme Starter is a basic starting point for creating a theme for the Mailspring email client. 
￼ 
Getting Started 
Creating a new theme in Mailspring is easy! Here’s how you can do it. https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring-Theme-Starter
Fork this repo or download the code. Add a name, display name, title, and description for your theme to package.json, and change the
directory name to match.
Open Mailspring and install the theme by going to Mailspring > Install New Theme... and selecting the directory.
Choose Developer > Run With Debug Flags for easier debugging.
Now, you can start playing with the theme! It’s installed in ~/Library/Application Support/Mailspring/packages/THEME_NAME (on
macOS), so open it from there. Most of Mailspring’s React components are derived from the core variables defined in ui-variables.less,
and any changes you make there will override the defaults for Mailspring. You can also add more LESS files in styles (ideally, separated
into logical components like thread-list.less) to make your own specific changes. To reload the theme, just open the console
(Developer > Toggle Developer Tools) and type 
AppEnv.themes.setActiveTheme('ui-light');
AppEnv.themes.setActiveTheme('your-theme-name');
 Once you’re happy with your theme, check how it looks in the theme picker (Mailspring > Change Theme...). We use your UI variables
to pull the colors, but if you want to add your own selections to the color palette, create a theme-colors.less file that includes any of the
variables that you want to change, and they’ll only affect the theme preview. Here are the variables, on the left, with the part of the theme
preview that they match: 
@background-secondary: BACKGROUND_COLOR
@text-color: TEXT_COLOR, FIRST_SWATCH_COLOR
@component-active-color: MIDDLE_SWATCH_COLOR
@toolbar-background-color: LAST_SWATCH_COLOR
@panel-background-color: STRIP_COLOR
